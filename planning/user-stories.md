## User Stories

# Musts

- As a user, I can have 4 different to-do lists: to watch, to eat, to read, to buy, because I want to easily refer back to these specific to-do lists.

- As a user, I can change a category of an item in case it was mis-categorized or could not be categorized at all.

- As a user, I can add the name of the item, and it gets put into the correct list–smart, auto-categorizing todo list app.

- As a user, I must be logged in to view my TODO list (this will be a ‘fake’ login). 

- As a user, I can update/edit my lists by either adding or deleting items from my list. 

- I need the app to suggest the category where each task should be set to (connect to APIs).

# Nice To Haves

- Be able to move the item by dragging it and placing it up or down based on priority (if relevant). 

- Colour code/add icons like a star to the items in the list that are the highest priority/allow the user to order by favorite.

- Pop up message congratulating a person for checking something off their TODO list. 

- Enter who has suggested a to do item and when it was suggested.

- Select multiple categories/items to delete.

- Add searchbar to the side to search within the categories so we don't have duplicate items in list.
